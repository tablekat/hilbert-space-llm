evaluate a new model of neural networks that, instead of taking tokens in as a finite dimensional vector embedding, treats them as an element of a Hilbert space, with subsequent matrix multiplications etc being replaced with operators on that Hilbert space. figure out the math for this, and evaluate the possibility of doing inference and training in frequency space, having done a Fourier transform of the elements
